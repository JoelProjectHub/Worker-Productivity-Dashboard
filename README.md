## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation and DAX measures.
- **SQL / Power Query**: Data extraction and transformation.
- **Excel Integration**: For legacy data and dynamic input sources.
- **DAX**: Calculations for rolling averages, productivity rates, and concern point percentages.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Data is extracted from internal databases and Excel files.
2. Power Query cleans and normalizes the data.
3. DAX measures calculate KPIs such as:
   - Average Productivity Rate
   - Concern Points %
   - Rolling 7-Day Performance
4. Interactive visuals allow management to filter by date, department, and worker.

## 📊 Business Impact
